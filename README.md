# MessengerDesktopApplication-Honors-Project-
I am creating a messenger like desktop application using Java for the client and C++ for the server. 
It's still an ongoing project, but currently usable

How to:
1) Use visual studio to open and run server or whatever IDE you prefer. You do not need to make any additions to the code.
2) Go on command prompt and type in ipconfig and scroll down to your IPV4 addrress.
2) Use another IDEA to open the java client and paste in your ipv4 adress address before running the code.
3) Start the client on another laptop and send messages to each other
**You need to be connected to the same wifi to work. Also, you can use as many clients as you want.Group Chat functional!

Coming Updates:
-G.U.I
-SQL Database
