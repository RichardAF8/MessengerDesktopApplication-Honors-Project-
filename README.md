# MessengerDesktopApplication-Honors-Project-
I created a messenger like desktop application using Java for the client and C++ for the server. Another individual I collaborated with had made the  android app version of my client (file included).

How to:
1) Download and import the files from this link

http://www.mediafire.com/folder/gqjwbckuoecym/Messaging_Application_(Java)

*I used visual studio for the server, intelliJ for the java desktop client (make sure javafx is installed) and android studio for the android app.

2) In the Java client go to the Main class and change the I.P address string in the TTS_Client constructor to your own I.P adress 

*Found at line 52 "client = new TTS_Client("10.0.0.127", 85);".

*Go on command prompt and type in ipconfig and scroll down to your IPV4 addrress to find your IP address.

3) Add the marytts library to the project (all the files from the jar folder).

*File -> Project Structure -> Modules - > Dependencies. click plus and navigate to the jar files in the jar folder and add them all.

4A) Use another IDEA or computer to open the java client and follow the same steps.

                                                                   OR
4B) Import and use the Android app, run, type in your ip address and set port number to 85 and then click connect.

*Type in messages and click send to send messages

5) All done!
