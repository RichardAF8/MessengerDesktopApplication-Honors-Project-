# MessengerDesktopApplication-Honors-Project-
I created a messenger like desktop application using Java for the client and C++ for the server. Another individual had made the  android app version of my client (file included).

How to:
1) Download and import the files from this link

http://www.mediafire.com/folder/gqjwbckuoecym/Messaging_Application_(Java)

*I used visual studio for the server, intelliJ for the java desktop client (make sure javafx is installed) and android studio for the android app.

2) In the Java client go to the Main claass and change the I.P address string in the TTS_Client constructor to your own I.P adress.

*Go on command prompt and type in ipconfig and scroll down to your IPV4 addrress to find your IP address.

4A) Use another IDEA or computer to open the java client and paste in your ipv4 adress address in the TTS_Client constructor before running the code. The 85 is the port number which you do not have to change.

                                                                   OR
4B) Import and use the Android app, run, type in your ip address and set port number to 85 and then click connect.

*Type in messages and click send to send messages

5) All done!
